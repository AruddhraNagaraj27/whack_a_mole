# About

**Whack-a-Mole (Flask Edition)** is a browser-based arcade game built using **Python Flask** for the backend and **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** for the frontend.

The goal of the game is simple: hit the mole as many times as you can before time runs out!
Players can enter their name, choose a difficulty level, and their score is saved using **SQLite with SQLAlchemy**. A leaderboard page displays the top scores, making the game competitive and replayable.
